# nonAttackingQueensGame_mytake
this or the "n-queens game" is a 2 players game, where each turn, one person place a queen into a board on a unattacked tile. Player who can't move when it's their turn is the loser.

### nAQ_Winner.cpp
Using brute-force to calculate all possible games on a N\*N board, take N as input, output the winner. (if they play optimally obviously)

### nAQ_Play.cpp
A program allows you to play against a optimally play CPU. (with visual assistance through writing image onto hard drive. this is convenient because most image viewers reload itself if its image file changes)

If the CPU cant win it will state that it's moving randomly. ood luck.

# Postscript
After letting a no-brainer's terribly-written, poorly-designed brute-force running about half an hour
